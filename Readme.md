# 🧳 AI Travel Planner (Gen AI Project)

The **AI Travel Planner** is a Generative AI-powered web application that creates **personalized travel itineraries**.  
Users can provide a **destination, trip duration, and budget**, and the AI generates a **day-wise plan** including sightseeing, food, and accommodations.  

This project demonstrates how **Gen AI** can be combined with **external APIs** (Google Maps, Booking.com, etc.) for smarter, real-time travel planning.
